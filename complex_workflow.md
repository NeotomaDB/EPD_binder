## Building New Chronologies

This RMarkdown document will walk you through the process of:

1.  Downloading pollen records from multiple sites
2.  Filtering for specific taxa and taxonomic harmonization
3.  Filtering and binning for specific time periods
4.  Linking to environmental data
5.  Performing simple SDMs for different time periods

## Load Libraries

For this workshop element we only need quite a few packages. We'll be loading multiple records from Neotoma, filtering by taxa and time periods, and preforming simple species distribution models.

We'll be using the R package `pacman` here, to automatically load and install packages. Note that we also use the package rpaleoclim to download the climate data, but since we have pre-downloaded the climate rasters for you, you will not need that package today. 


```r
pacman::p_load(neotoma2, dplyr, ggplot2, remotes, terra, sf)
```

## Loading Datasets 

We worked through the process for finding and downloading records using `neotoma2` in the [previous workshop](https://open.neotomadb.org/Current_Workshop/simple_workflow.html). For this exercise we will be pulling pollen records from all of Europe to contstruct species distribution models for select species for different time periods. The following code defines our region of interest (a simple polygon of Europe) and downloads the sites, dataset, and downloads for all pollen records that are not missing an age depth model. This is the same workflow as the simple workflow we completed in the morning session but condensed to a few lines of code. Downloading this volume of data from Neotoma can take a long time and is computationally expensive for the database itself so we have already completed the data download and here you will read in the data from our data folder.Under the results you can take a look at all the sites we downloaded. 

#### Code 

```r
europe <-  '{"type": "Polygon",
"coordinates": [[
 [ -32.13,66.46],
 [-14.09,36.93],
 [30.16,34.71],
 [35.79,69.17],
 [-32.13,66.46]]]}'
europe_sf <- geojsonsf::geojson_sf(europe)

## The following lines of code are commented out because we've already run it for you to speed up the process. 
# Downloading large amounts of data can take a long time.
# europe_sites <- neotoma2::get_sites(loc = europe, datasettype = "pollen", all_data = TRUE)
# europe_datasets <- neotoma2::get_datasets(loc = europe, datasettype = "pollen", all_data = TRUE)
# europe_records <- europe_datasets %>% 
#   neotoma2::filter(!is.na(age_range_young))
# europe_downloads <- europe_records %>% get_downloads(all_data = TRUE)
# europe_samples <- samples(europe_downloads)
# 
# saveRDS(europe_sites, "data/europe_sites.RDS")
# saveRDS(europe_datasets, "data/europe_datasets.RDS")
# saveRDS(europe_downloads, "data/europe_downloads.RDS")
# saveRDS(europe_samples, "data/europe_samples.RDS")

europe_sites <- readRDS("data/europe_sites.RDS")
europe_datasets <- readRDS("data/europe_datasets.RDS")
europe_downloads <- readRDS("data/europe_downloads.RDS")
europe_samples <- readRDS("data/europe_samples.RDS")
```

The mountains are composed predominantly of granite with contact aureole schists at the margins. The steep sided valley was deepened by glacial activity during the last glaciation (Coxon et al. 2012). The valley is flooded by two lakes which are separated by an alluvial fan deposited by a stream flowing down the centre of the southern wall of the valley. The Lower Lake (Irish Grid ref: T 118 966; Long. 06˚20’30”W Lat. 53˚00’30”N) is bounded on its western margin by the alluvial fan, the north and south margins are the steep valley sides and the eastern margin at the mouth of the valley is formed by a delta derived from an earlier lake that filled the valley (Coxon et al. 2012). The Upper Lake flows into the Lower Lake via a river that has cut through the fan deposit. The Lower Lake is approximately 300 m long (east-west) and 150 m wide (north-south); water depth is 13 m at its deepest point. The Lower Lake lies at an altitude of 130 m OD. The valley walls are now covered by semi-natural oak woods and plantations of exotic conifers which open out onto mountain heathland at higher altitudes. During the last century, mining activity led to the lowering of the water level in the Lower Lake by two metres (Anon 1990). The coring site was on the western margin of the Lower Lake. This was in the shore zone that is seasonally flooded. Due to the lowering of the water level in the last century, the sediments were lacustrine (rather than alluvial fan) deposits and were overlain by peat.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=11577>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Borheen Lough<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The Galtee Mountains (or Na Gaibhlte in Irish) lie in the southern part of the country and are Ireland's highest inland mountain range.

The area stretches for 6 km from southwest to northeast and 2 km in an east to west direction. Lina myr drains in a northeast direction toward the east coast of\r\nGotland via the Gothem River. The Gothem River was straightened during the draining of the fen in the 1940s. Today, the elevation\r\nof the Lina myr fen is about 9 m a.s.l. The original basin threshold is estimated to be 9.5–9.9 m a.s.l., based on a cross-section established from modern digital evaluation models (Barliaev, 2017). To the west of the fen the surface geology consists of marl and\r\nfurther to the west of glacial till (Figure 1c). To the east, limestone bedrock is exposed. The island of Gotland consists of Silurian\r\nlimestone (Hede, 1925).

### Data Filtering 
Taxon filtering and harmonization, pollen percent calculations, and data exploration 

Before we can start looking at our focal species we need to do some work with our sample table so that we have all the information we want. We need to do three things at this step: filtering the data to only include our focal taxa, doing taxon harmonization on our focal taxa, and calculating the pollen percent for each focal taxa for each pollen sample. 

Our first task is to make a table that we will join with our samples table that tells us the total number of pollen per sample which we will use in our pollen percentage calculations. There are many decisions you can make at this step depending on your research question but here we are going to calculate pollen percent based on the total number of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous groups (ecologicalgroup = TRSH and UPHE). This is common for may studies that focus on these ecological groups but know that you can choose other combinations and this will effect how you interpret your results.  

Then we can combine taxon filtering and harmonization and pollen percent calculation all in one segment of code. Here we are selecting the taxa *Fagus*, *Picea*, and *Corylus* and harmonizing all variations of those taxa to the genus level. 

#### Code

```r
poll_total <- europe_samples %>%
  filter(ecologicalgroup == "TRSH" | ecologicalgroup == "UPHE") %>% 
  group_by(datasetid, age) %>%
  summarise(totalpollen = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup() 

europe_subset <- europe_samples %>%
  inner_join(poll_total, by = c("datasetid" = "datasetid", "age" = "age")) %>%
  mutate(poll_perc = round(value/totalpollen*100, 2)) %>%
  #filter to only taxa with the genera of our focal species
  filter(stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Fagus*") | 
           stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Picea*") | 
           stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Corylus*")) %>%
  #limiting the age to the range of ages we are interesting in. Here -74 is present since "radiocarbon years before present" starts at 1950
  filter(age >= -74 & age <= 23000) %>% 
  #rename our focal species to just their genera
  mutate(variablename = replace(variablename, stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Fagus*"), "Fagus"), 
         variablename = replace(variablename, stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Picea*"), "Picea"), 
         variablename = replace(variablename, stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Corylus*"), "Corylus")) %>%
  #group taxa of the same dataset and age to combine all renamed versions of taxa to get one pollen percent value for a harmonized record 
  group_by(datasetid, age, variablename, units, ecologicalgroup, sitename, lat, long) %>%
  summarise(pollen_percent = sum(poll_perc)) %>%
  mutate(presence = case_when(pollen_percent > 1 ~ 1,
                              .default = 0))
```

### Bin and filter data by time 
Now that we have a dataset with our three focal taxa we now want to filter these taxa into time periods of interest. For this exercise we will be looking at modern samples (1950 to present), the Younger Drays (12.9 to 11.7 thousand years ago), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 thousand years ago). 

#### Code

```r
europe_binned <- europe_subset %>% 
  mutate(timebins = case_when(age <= 0 ~ "Modern",
                             age >= 11700 & age <= 12900 ~ "YD", 
                             age >= 20000 & age <= 22000 ~ "LGM",
                             .default = NA)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(timebins))
```

## Species Distribution Models 

Now that we have our taxa data and our climate data ready to go we will now extract climate data for each of the samples, create SDMs, and predict species distributions for all three taxa in all three time periods.  

#### Extracting environmental varliables

```r
#First lets save the projection information from our climate data to use later when creating our species points data
proj_data <- crs(europe_clim_mod)

#next we will split our taxa data into time bins
taxa_mod <- filter(europe_binned, timebins == "Modern")
taxa_yd <- filter(europe_binned, timebins == "YD")
taxa_lgm <- filter(europe_binned, timebins == "LGM")

# Now we will convert these to spatial points and extract the climate data
## Modern
taxa_mod <- st_as_sf(taxa_mod, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = proj_data)
taxa_mod_vect <- vect(taxa_mod$geometry)
taxa_mod_clims <- terra::extract(europe_clim_mod, taxa_mod_vect)
taxa_mod <- cbind(taxa_mod, taxa_mod_clims)
corylus_mod <- filter(taxa_mod, variablename == "Corylus")
fagus_mod <- filter(taxa_mod, variablename == "Fagus")
picea_mod <- filter(taxa_mod, variablename == "Picea")

## Younger Dryas
taxa_yd <- st_as_sf(taxa_yd, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = proj_data)
taxa_yd_vect <- vect(taxa_yd$geometry)
taxa_yd_clims <- terra::extract(europe_clim_yd, taxa_yd_vect)
taxa_yd <- cbind(taxa_yd, taxa_yd_clims)
corylus_yd <- filter(taxa_yd, variablename == "Corylus")
fagus_yd <- filter(taxa_yd, variablename == "Fagus")
picea_yd <- filter(taxa_yd, variablename == "Picea")

## Last Glacial Maximum 
taxa_lgm <- st_as_sf(taxa_lgm, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = proj_data)
taxa_lgm_vect <- vect(taxa_lgm$geometry)
taxa_lgm_clims <- terra::extract(europe_clim_lgm, taxa_lgm_vect)
taxa_lgm <- cbind(taxa_lgm, taxa_lgm_clims)
corylus_lgm <- filter(taxa_lgm, variablename == "Corylus")
fagus_lgm <- filter(taxa_lgm, variablename == "Fagus")
picea_lgm <- filter(taxa_lgm, variablename == "Picea")
```

## Summary

From this notebook we have learned how to:

1.  Download a single record (the monticchio record using `get_downloads()`)
2.  Examining the chronologies for the record (using `chronologies()` and associated chronological controls (using `chroncontrols()`)
3.  Creating a new chronology for the record (using `set_chronology()`)
4.  Adding the chronology to the record (using `add_chronology()`)
5.  Switching between default chronologies (using `set_default()`)

This approach is focused on a single record, but much of what is done here can be extended to multiple records using functions. We hope it's been helpful!
